3. Use red wire for positive connections and black wire for ground

### Step 3: Mount the RC522 Module
1. Place the RC522 module on the breadboard or use a separate small breadboard
2. Ensure all pins are accessible for wiring
3. The RC522 module should be positioned for easy access to RFID cards

### Step 4: Make SPI Connections
1. **MOSI Connection**: Connect ESP32 GPIO23 to RC522 MOSI pin using blue wire
2. **MISO Connection**: Connect ESP32 GPIO19 to RC522 MISO pin using green wire
3. **SCK Connection**: Connect ESP32 GPIO18 to RC522 SCK pin using yellow wire
4. **SDA Connection**: Connect ESP32 GPIO5 to RC522 SDA pin using orange wire

### Step 5: Connect Control Signals
1. **Reset Connection**: Connect ESP32 GPIO22 to RC522 RST pin using purple wire
2. **Power Connection**: Connect RC522 VCC to 3.3V power rail using red wire
3. **Ground Connection**: Connect RC522 GND to ground rail using black wire

### Step 6: Add Optional Components (if desired)
1. **Green LED**: Connect anode to GPIO2 through 220Ω resistor, cathode to ground
2. **Red LED**: Connect anode to GPIO4 through 220Ω resistor, cathode to ground
3. **Buzzer**: Connect positive terminal to GPIO15, negative to ground

## Verification Steps

### Visual Inspection
1. **Check all connections** against the wiring diagram
2. **Verify power connections** - ensure no short circuits
3. **Confirm pin assignments** match the software configuration
4. **Check component orientation** - LEDs and buzzer polarity

### Continuity Testing
1. Use a multimeter to verify connections
2. Check for short circuits between power and ground
3. Verify each signal wire reaches its destination
4. Test power supply voltage (should be 3.3V)

### Power-On Test
1. Connect ESP32 to computer via USB cable
2. Check that power LED on ESP32 illuminates
3. Verify RC522 module receives power (some modules have power LEDs)
4. No smoke or unusual heating should occur

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### RC522 Not Detected
- **Check Power**: Verify 3.3V supply to RC522 VCC pin
- **Verify Connections**: Ensure all SPI pins are correctly connected
- **Check Wiring**: Look for loose connections or incorrect pin assignments
- **Module Defect**: Try a different RC522 module if available

### Cards Not Reading
- **Distance**: Ensure card is within 2-5cm of RC522 antenna
- **Card Type**: Verify using compatible RFID cards (MIFARE Classic recommended)
- **Interference**: Remove other electronic devices that might cause interference
- **Antenna**: Check RC522 antenna coil for damage

### ESP32 Not Programming
- **USB Cable**: Try a different USB cable (data cable, not charge-only)
- **Drivers**: Install ESP32 USB-to-serial drivers
- **Boot Mode**: Hold BOOT button while pressing RESET to enter programming mode
- **Port Selection**: Verify correct COM port is selected

### Power Issues
- **Voltage**: Measure 3.3V supply with multimeter
- **Current**: Ensure power supply can provide sufficient current (>500mA)
- **Connections**: Check power and ground connections are secure
- **USB Power**: Try different USB ports or powered USB hub
